title:  "Dec 17 - Umdloti"

It was time to hit the beach for real. We did some internet research and came to the conclusion that Umdloti beach might just be the best place to go with little kids. Long story short, it did deliver.

We had to convince some people to actually let us drive up to the beach, as it was Saturday and they had road blocks in place, in order to manage the traffic going to and from the beach. Some areas were temporarily labeled as residents only.

That said, it took us about 5 minutes to find a place to park our car, right next to the beach.

Baden im Indischen Ozean, über und in die Wellen springen, auf den Felsen herumklettern, nach Krebsen, Korallen, Muscheln und Fischen suchen, im Sand buddeln, ...

Die Zeit am Strand verflog in Windeseile und auf dem Weg nach Hause schliefen beide Kinder erschöpft in ihren Sitzen ein.

Umdloti's beaches are spacious, (usually) easily accessible, and equipped with showers and toilets.

There are so many things to explore and investigate - fish, crabs, sea shells, ...
