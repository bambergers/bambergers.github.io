The way a text is written heavily influences how potential follow-up discussion will be led. We can witness this circumstance every day, when reading articles on the internet. If the original author follows the common scientific practice to include references and sources to backup their statements, commenting people will start doing the same.

Of course, it's to be expected that the level of sophistication will degrade over time when more comments are added. On the other hand, a discussion hardly ever increases in quality.

### Rundungsgenauigkeit
In physics we calculate our results to a certain level of exactness. This level is usually determined by the least exact measurement. Hence our results's granularity depends on the calculation's input. [tbc]

### Everyone is an author
People may think that arbitrary posts on platforms like facebook or twitter might not qualify as proper articles. However, I believe that anyone who writes even just the shortest of texts on the internet probably does so, because they want to reach a potential reader and kindle their interest. Reading this, you might think, "No, I don't care about other people.", but really, if you knew for sure that not even a single person would ever read what you're about to write, would you continue? For the people arguing that they might as well write something just for themselves, please read the paragraph again, while keeping in mind that you yourself are most likely a person, too.

### Don't trust the internet
If you decide to improve your future posts, you need to learn how to judge a link's quality. People keep referencing other pages which, more often than not, just copied a statement from yet another source. Things become even trickier if we consider language barriers. It should be clear that any translation always adds room for interpretation, as well as mistakes. Additionally, non-native speakers of any language have a tendency to construct sentences on their mother tongue before trying to write them down. Keeping this in mind, we ideally include references to original sources instead of pre-processed information.
