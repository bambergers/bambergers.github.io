Now that you found your way to my blog and to this post in particular, I might as well explain why I am writing this. It is actually quite simple.

#### I forget.
Since I work from home there are usually not that many people around whom I could ask about things that I have forgotten. Of course, there is mail, chat, IM, twitter, etc. However, I feel much better about myself when I can figure things out on my own. Especially, since not all the stuff that I forget is work related. But you will see that, if you read more of my blog posts.

#### I write for myself.
You are invited to browse through my collected memories and thoughts. Not sure how interesting this might be to you, though. There won't be any private photos or secret confessions. It is not like I would try to hide anything, but at the same time, I don't feel the need to share a lot about my private life. If you read all my posts, you might end up having quite a comprehensive picture about myself, but if you are really interested in getting to know me, there are most likely better ways to achieve that than wasting your time on my blog.
