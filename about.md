We're a family of four and this is our blog. It will serve as a place to share experiences with our loved ones.

### Language
Most of our relatives speak German. A lot of our friends and co-workers don't. However, we want this blog to be available to both of those groups, which is why we decided to write most of this blog's entries in English, while our diary will be in German.

# Sonntag, 4. Dezember
Bald geht es los. Der Blog ist schon fast fertig.
Tagebucheinträge wie dieser werden immer in Deutsch erscheinen. Der Rest des Blogs bleibt Englisch.

Viel Spaß beim Lesen!

### Pictures
We definitely want to post pictures, but at the same time, we don't want to expose too much private information to the public. As a result, you won't find our faces on any of this site's pages. We also won't share the names of any pets, mothers' maiden names, or other answers to typical security questions. ;-)

Photos will be posted in their native resolution, i.e. as created by our mobile phones. We won't create preview thumbnails. This means, it might take a while for some pages to fully load. On the other hand, this will enable you to zoom in on the pictures, download them, and/or even print some of them.

The pictures will also be geo-tagged, which allows to follow along with our travels.
